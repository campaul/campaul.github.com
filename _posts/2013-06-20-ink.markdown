I have years of experience with pencil and paint, but I've never really used ink before. Needless to say my first week with a technical pen proved interesting. Ink has precision and permanence that I've never explored, but it makes for some stunning line drawings.

Before the ink though, an old piece finally scanned.

Now for the ink. As a warm up I did a simple sketch of an eye. It's nothing special but it helped me adjust to the pen.

And finally, my first serious attempt: Radical Edward.
