I recently began working on a project to create a series of screencasts following the development of a simple game engine and example game using JavaScript and HTML5. The game engine, which I've called [urge.js](https://github.com/campaul/urge.js), can be found on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/campaul).

The first video in the series establishes some of the basic constructs of the game engine including the game loop. Although this video doesn't seem to cover much, it lays the foundation for future videos covering input, animation, collision, sound, and other interesting topics.

Watch [“Creating a Video Game from Scratch : Part 1”](https://vimeo.com/48621472).
